Incident Summary:

The system recorded {resumen['login_failures']} failed login attempt(s), indicating possible brute-force activity. 
There were {resumen['login_successes']} successful login(s), which appear normal.

Detected {resumen['sql_injections']} SQL injection attempt(s), suggesting a direct attack on the application's database.

Additionally, there were {resumen['suspicious_uploads']} suspicious file upload(s), which could be a sign of remote shell injection.

Recommendations:
- Block repeated failed login IPs temporarily.
- Review database firewall rules.
- Inspect uploaded files for backdoors.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts.
