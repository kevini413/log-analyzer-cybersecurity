# Log Analyzer for Cybersecurity

This project simulates an entry-level cybersecurity log analysis workflow. It processes basic server logs and generates a professional English-language report with security insights and actionable recommendations.

## Features

- Counts failed and successful login attempts
- Detects SQL injection attempts
- Detects suspicious file uploads
- Generates a simulated AI-style incident report

## Files

- `log.txt` – Sample log input (simulated)
- `analizar_logs.py` – Python log analyzer script
- `report.txt` – Final generated report
- `README.md` – Project overview

## AI Simulation

This project includes a simulated AI-generated report. In a real-world scenario, the report could be generated using a language model (e.g. ChatGPT) via the OpenAI API. In this version, the report is generated locally and simulates how AI assistance might work in a production setting.
