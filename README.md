## 🧠 Features

- Counts failed/successful login attempts
- Detects SQL injection attempts
- Detects suspicious file uploads
- Outputs a simulated AI-style report in English

## 📁 Files

- `log.txt` – Sample log input (simulated)
- `analizar_logs.py` – Python log analyzer script
- `report.txt` – Final generated report
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 💡 AI Simulation

This project includes a simulated AI-generated report. In a real-world scenario, a language model such as ChatGPT could be integrated using the OpenAI API. This version keeps it offline and cost-free for demonstration purposes.
